    <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>
      Machine learning (ML) is a smart computer technique where machines learn
      from data. It's like teaching a computer to recognize patterns and make
      predictions without being explicitly programmed. Imagine it as teaching a
      pet to fetch a ball by showing it different balls - the more it sees, the
      better it gets. ML helps in things like predicting weather, recommending
      movies, or spotting spam emails by using data to make decisions, just like
      how we learn from experiences to make choices. It's a cool way for
      computers to become smarter and help us solve all kinds of problems.
