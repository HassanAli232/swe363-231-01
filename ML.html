      <p>
        Machine learning (ML) is a smart computer technique where machines learn
        from data. It's like teaching a computer to recognize patterns and make
        predictions without being explicitly programmed. Imagine it as teaching
        a pet to fetch a ball by showing it different balls - the more it sees,
        the better it gets. ML helps in things like predicting weather,
        recommending movies, or spotting spam emails by using data to make
        decisions, just like how we learn from experiences to make choices. It's
        a cool way for computers to become smarter and help us solve all kinds
        of problems.

            Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent
            variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear
            equation. It's used for predicting a continuous outcome.

            Logistic regression is used for binary classification tasks. It
            models the probability that a given input belongs to one of two
            classes using the logistic function.

            Decision trees recursively partition data into subsets based on the
            values of input features, leading to a tree-like structure. They are
            used for both classification and regression tasks.

            K-NN is a simple instance-based learning algorithm. It classifies
            data points by the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors in
            feature space.

            SVM is a powerful algorithm for binary classification. It finds the
            optimal hyperplane that best separates two classes in
            high-dimensional space.
